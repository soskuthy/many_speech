alignment was run on a Mac laptop as follows:

# installing MFA:

conda create -n mfa
conda activate mfa
conda install montreal-forced-aligner

# testing alignment
# with data as working directory

mfa validate audio_edited ../alignment/german_mfa_edited.dict german_mfa --ignore_acoustics

# manually edited the dictionary as follows, and saved as
# alignment/german_mfa_edited.dict

### (this last entry is a bit of a hack, as the /a/ tends to be long and nasalised, and the /ʃ/ is often voiced, but neither of these phones are in the mfa phone set)

# ran validation again

mfa validate audio_edited ../alignment/german_mfa_edited.dict german_mfa --ignore_acoustics

# and alignment!

mfa align audio_edited ../alignment/german_mfa_edited.dict german_mfa audio_final
